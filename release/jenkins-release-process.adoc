= Release Process (Jenkins)

Details for releasing ORM via a Jenkins job.

The release can alternatively be performed manually - see <<./manual-release-process.adoc>> for details.

== Resources

First, a list of resources you will need access to in order to perform a release:

* Post permissions for both hibernate-dev and hibernate-announce mailing lists
* Post permissions for Hibernate forums
* Post permissions for both G+ and Twitter


== Steps

1. Perform `./gradlew preVerifyRelease` locally (after pulling all upstream changes).  The Jenkins job does only the release steps, and we need to make sure tests and checkstyle especially are ok
2. Mark the version as released in Jira
3. Close all issues associated with the version as closed.  Be sure to remove the version from any issues that are not resolved (e.g. rejected) - the Jira "release notes" mechanism includes all issues with that version as the fix-for regardless of the resolution
4. Start the https://ci.hibernate.org/view/Release/job/hibernate-orm-release-jdk17/[Jenkins job].  It is a parameterized build - Jenkins will prompt user for needed information:
.. The version to be released (e.g. 7.0.0.Final)
.. The next development version (e.g. 7.0.1-SNAPSHOT)
.. The GitHub branch from which to release

The Jenkins job performs the following tasks:

1. sets the version to the provided release version
2. updates the changelog with the info from Jira
3. performs bintray, sourceforge and documentation upload
4. tags the version and push it to github
5. changes the version to the provided development version
6. push to github
