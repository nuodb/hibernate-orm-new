=== Configuration via properties file

In this example, configuration properties are specified in a file named `hibernate.properties`.

.Configuration via `hibernate.properties`
[source,properties]
----
# Database connection settings
hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:h2:mem:db1;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
hibernate.connection.username=sa
hibernate.connection.password=

# Echo all executed SQL to console
hibernate.show_sql=true
hibernate.format_sql=true
hibernate.highlight_sql=true

# Automatically export the schema
hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create
----

The following properties specify JDBC connection information:

.JDBC connection settings
[%breakable,cols="35,~"]
|===
| Configuration property name | Purpose

| `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.url` | JDBC URL of your database
| `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.user` and `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.password` | Your database credentials
|===

[NOTE]
These tutorials use the H2 embedded database, so the values of these properties are specific to running H2 in its in-memory mode.

These properties enable logging of SQL to the console as it is executed, in an aesthetically pleasing format:

.Settings for SQL logging to the console
[%breakable,cols="35,~"]
|===
| Configuration property name | Purpose

| `hibernate.show_sql`        | If `true`, log SQL directly to the console
| `hibernate.format_sql`      | If `true`, log SQL in a multiline, indented format
| `hibernate.highlight_sql`   | If `true`, log SQL with syntax highlighting via ANSI escape codes
|===

When developing persistence logic with Hibernate, it's very important to be able to see exactly what SQL is being executed.

[[hibernate-gsg-tutorial-annotations-entity]]
=== The annotated entity Java class

The entity class in this tutorial is `org.hibernate.tutorial.annotations.Event`.
Observe that:

- This class uses standard JavaBean naming conventions for property getter and setter methods, as well as private visibility for the fields.
  This is recommended, but it's not a requirement.
- The no-argument constructor, which is also a JavaBean convention, _is_ a requirement for all persistent classes.
  Hibernate needs to instantiate objects for you, using Java Reflection.
  The constructor should have package-private or `public` visibility, to allow Hibernate to generate proxies and optimized code for field access.

[NOTE]
The link:{entity-model-url}[Entity types] section of the User Guide covers the complete set of requirements for the entity class.

We use annotations to identify the class as an entity, and to map it to the relational schema.

[[hibernate-gsg-tutorial-annotations-entity-entity]]
.Identifying the class as an entity
[source, java]
----
@Entity   <1>
@Table(name = "Events")   <2>
public class Event {
    ...
}
----
<1> `@jakarta.persistence.Entity` marks the `Event` class as an entity.
<2> `@jakarta.persistence.Table` explicitly specifies the name of the mapped table.
  Without this annotation, the table name would default to `Event`.

Every entity class must have an identifier.

[[hibernate-gsg-tutorial-annotations-entity-id]]
.Identifying the identifier property
[source, java]
----
@Id   <1>
@GeneratedValue   <2>
private Long id;
----

<1> `@jakarta.persistence.Id` marks the field as holding the identifier (primary key) of the entity.
<2> `@jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue` specifies that this is a _synthetic id_, that is, a system-generated identifier (a surrogate primary key).

Other fields of the entity are considered persistent by default.

[[hibernate-gsg-tutorial-annotations-entity-properties]]
.Mapping basic properties
[source, java]
----
private String title;

@Column(name = "eventDate")   <1>
private LocalDateTime date;
----

<1> `@jakarta.persistence.Column` explicitly specifies the name of a mapped column.
  Without this annotation, the column name would default to `date`, which is a keyword on some databases.


[[hibernate-gsg-tutorial-annotations-test]]
=== Example code

The class `org.hibernate.tutorial.annotations.HibernateIllustrationTest` illustrates the use of the Hibernate's native APIs, including:

- `Session` and `SessionFactory`, and
- `org.hibernate.boot` for configuration and bootstrap.

There are several different ways to configure and start Hibernate, and this is not even the most common approach.

[NOTE]
The examples in these tutorials are presented as JUnit tests.
A benefit of this approach is that `setUp()` and `tearDown()` roughly illustrate how a `org.hibernate.SessionFactory` is
created when the program starts, and closed when the program terminates.

[[hibernate-gsg-tutorial-basic-test-setUp]]
.Obtaining the `SessionFactory`
[source, java]
----
protected void setUp() {
    // A SessionFactory is set up once for an application!
    final StandardServiceRegistry registry =
            new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder()
                    .build();   <1> <2>
    try {
        sessionFactory =
                new MetadataSources(registry)             <3>
                        .addAnnotatedClass(Event.class)   <4>
                        .buildMetadata()                  <5>
                        .buildSessionFactory();           <6>
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        // The registry would be destroyed by the SessionFactory, but we
        // had trouble building the SessionFactory so destroy it manually.
        StandardServiceRegistryBuilder.destroy(registry);
    }
}
----
<1> The `setUp()` method first builds a `StandardServiceRegistry` instance which incorporates configuration information into a working set of `Services` for use by the `SessionFactory`.
<2> Here we put all configuration information in `hibernate.properties`, so there's not much interesting to see.
<3> Using the `StandardServiceRegistry` we create the `MetadataSources` which lets us tell Hibernate about our domain model.
<4> Here we have only one entity class to register.
<5> An instance of `Metadata` represents a complete, partially-validated view of the application domain model.
<6> The final step in the bootstrap process is to build a `SessionFactory` for the configured services and validated domain model.
The `SessionFactory` is a thread-safe object that's instantiated once to serve the entire application.

The `SessionFactory` produces instances of `Session`.
Each session should be thought of as representing a _unit of work_.

[[hibernate-gsg-tutorial-basic-test-saving]]
.Persisting entities
[source, java]
----
sessionFactory.inTransaction(session -> {   <1>
    session.persist(new Event("Our very first event!", now()));   <2>
    session.persist(new Event("A follow up event", now()));
});
----
<1> The `inTransaction()` method creates a session and starts a new transaction.
<2> Here we create two new `Event` objects and hands them over to Hibernate, calling the `persist()` method to make these instances persistent.
Hibernate is responsible for executing an `INSERT` statement for each `Event`.


[[hibernate-gsg-tutorial-basic-test-list]]
.Obtaining a list of entities
[source, java]
----
sessionFactory.inTransaction(session -> {
    session.createSelectionQuery("from Event", Event.class)   <1>
            .getResultList()   <2>
            .forEach(event -> out.println("Event (" + event.getDate() + ") : " + event.getTitle()));
});
----

<1> Here we use a very simple _Hibernate Query Language_ (HQL) statement to load all existing `Event` objects from the database.
<2> Hibernate generates and executes the appropriate `SELECT` statement, and then instantiates and populates `Event` objects with the data in the query result set.

.Practice Exercises
- [ ] Actually run this example to see the SQL executed by Hibernate displayed in the console.
- [ ] Reconfigure the examples to connect to your own persistent relational database.
- [ ] Add an association to the `Event` entity to model a message thread.
