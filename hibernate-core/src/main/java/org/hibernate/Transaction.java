/**
 * Represents a resource-local transaction, where <em>resource-local</em> is interpreted
 * by Hibernate to mean any transaction under the control of Hibernate. That is to say,
 * the underlying transaction might be a JTA transaction, or it might be a JDBC transaction,
 * depending on how Hibernate is configured.
 * <p>
 * Every resource-local transaction is associated with a {@link Session} and begins with
 * an explicit call to {@link Session#beginTransaction()}, or, equivalently, with
 * {@code session.getTransaction().begin()}, and ends with a call to {@link #commit()}
 * or {@link #rollback()}.
 * <p>
 * A single session might span multiple transactions since the notion of a session
 * (a conversation between the application and the datastore) is of coarser granularity
 * than the concept of a database transaction. However, there is at most one uncommitted
 * transaction associated with a given {@link Session} at any time.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is never used to control container managed JTA transactions,
 * and is not usually used to control transactions that affect multiple resources.
 * <p>
 * A {@code Transaction} object is not threadsafe.
