 * Marker interface for Fetches that are actually references to
 * another fetch based on "normalized navigable path"
 *
 * The following query is used throughout the javadocs for these impls
 * to help describe what it going on and why certain methods do certain things.
 *
 *
 * ```
 * @Entity
 * class Person {
 *     ...
 *     @ManyToOne (mappedBy="owner")
 *     Address getAddress() {...}
 * }
 *
 * @Entity
 * class Address {
 *     ...
 *     @ManyToOne
 *     Person getOwner() {...}
 * }
 *
 * from Person p
 * 		join fetch p.address a
 * 		join fetch a.owner o
 * 		join fetch o.address oa
 * ```
 *
 *
 * Here we have one root result and 3 fetches.  2 of the fetches are bi-directional:
 *
 * 		`o`:: The paths `p` and `p.address.owner` (aliased as `o`) are the same table reference in SQL terms
 * 		`oa`:: The paths `p.address` and `p.address.owner.address` (aliased as `oa`) are again the same table reference
